# Bellman-Ford Algorithm Visualizer 🚀

A simple web-based project built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* that visualizes the working of the *Bellman–Ford shortest path algorithm*.

## 🔍 Features
- Input your own graph (edges, weights, source vertex)
- Detects negative weight cycles
- Displays shortest distance to each vertex
- Clean UI and fully browser-based

## 🧠 Algorithm
The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.  
It can handle *negative weights* and detect *negative cycles*.

## ⚙ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bellman-ford-visualizer.git
   cd bellman-ford-visualizer
